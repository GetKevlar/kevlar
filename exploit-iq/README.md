# ExploitIQ (Proprietary Add on)

> "It's so easy even your CISO can use it." – ExploitIQ tagline

ExploitIQ is an optional add‑on for Kevlar that brings natural‑language,
AI‑powered insights to your vulnerability management workflow. While
Kevlar focuses on collecting and correlating Known Exploited
Vulnerabilities (KEVs) with your device inventory, ExploitIQ takes the
next step by translating raw technical data into executive‑ready
summaries and actionable recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Natural language queries** – Ask questions such as “What KEVs
  impacted us this week?” or “Summarize the top vulnerabilities by
  severity.” and receive clear, concise answers.
- **Executive summaries** – Generate board‑level explanations of
  individual CVEs, including business impact, remediation steps and
  historical exploitation context.
- **Triage assistance** – Automatically classify and prioritize
  findings using AI‑driven heuristics (e.g., remote code execution vs.
  privilege escalation).
- **Integrated with Slack and Jira** – Embed AI‑generated insights
  directly in your existing tickets and alerts, giving analysts and
  executives the context they need without switching tools.

## Availability

ExploitIQ is currently proprietary and offered separately from the
open‑source Kevlar core. To learn more about access, pricing and
licensing, please contact the maintainers or sign up for updates on
our upcoming launch page.

Stay tuned as we continue to build this experience. Our goal is to
make vulnerability intelligence accessible to everyone in your
organization – from engineers to executives.
