"""CISA KEV ingestion module.

This module fetches the latest Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs) from
the CISA catalog.  In a production implementation, this function would make
an HTTP request to the CISA API endpoint, parse the response, and return
records in a normalized format.  For now, it returns an empty list as a
placeholder.
